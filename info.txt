python -v
it gives all sort of weird import messages and goes into python repl
not sure it will affect things later

I don't get how to upgrade python in local env, give up trying curses for now.


Try with prettytable, static data set of x,y binary points:

pip install prettytable
Successfully installed prettytable-3.8.0 wcwidth-0.2.6
...

Python" is the name of the Python executable, while "py" is a command that is used to invoke
the Python interpreter on Windows. The version numbers that are displayed when you run these
commands may be different because they are referring to different versions of Python.


py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
using this instead, still trying to install curses...

Successfully installed pip-23.2.1 setuptools-68.0.0 wheel-0.41.0

python --version or python -V gives 3.8.0
but on the bottom right of vscode there's 3.10.5 64-bit
why virtual env gets the older version?

try again installing the curses wheel for v 3.8:
pip install C:/Users/kk88/Desktop/CS50P_2023/life/curses-2.2.1+utf8-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
nope
try this:
pip install C:/Users/kk88/Desktop/CS50P_2023/life/windows_curses-2.3.1-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
nope
try:
pip install C:/Users/kk88/Desktop/CS50P_2023/life/windows_curses-2.3.1-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl
nope, no clue what to do..

trying last:
pip install C:/Users/kk88/Desktop/CS50P_2023/life/curses-2.2.1+utf8-cp38-cp38-win32.whl


try:
import platform
platform.architecture()
>>('64bit', 'ELF')

....
 

pip intall pygame			note: installed both in system python and virtual env
Successfully installed pygame-2.5.0

(make sure the script is not called pygame)

suppressed ALSA warnings by using pygame.font.init() rather than pygame.init()

downgrading to pygame 2.4.0

always get the same output on terminal and not extra window, what am I doing wrong?
Hello from the pygame community. https://www.pygame.org/contribute.html

-------------------------

tryng things from this:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAmn4Bhkr3M

in cmd prompt: pip install pygame
Successfully installed pygame-2.5.0


it works in cmd but no in wsl terminal, not sure why (cmd is running in the main python environment I think)

all good, trying to submit, need to run tests:
Installing collected packages: tomli, pluggy, iniconfig, exceptiongroup, pytest

Installed pytest but struggling to 'see it':
trying to add the dir to PATH (https://fabianlee.org/2021/12/23/vscode-add-a-directory-to-the-terminal-path/):

added to settings.json but still not working..

try in wsl rather than cmd:
source env1/bin/activate
life-game_fg3.py runs, I see the count increasing (no pygame window though, no game, ALSA lib issues..);
pytest test_life-game.py > not found, try the suggestion:
sudo apt install python-pytest
putting in sudo password but nothing happens?? try:
